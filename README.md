# Linear-Search
## This will teach you working of linear search. ðŸ˜„
Linear search is also called as sequential search algorithm. It is the simplest searching algorithm. In Linear search, we simply traverse the list completely and match each element of the list with the item whose location is to be found. If the match is found, then the location of the item is returned; otherwise, the algorithm returns NULL.

It is widely used to search an element from the unordered list, i.e., the list in which items are not sorted. The worst-case time complexity of linear search is O(n).

### The steps used in the implementation of Linear Search are listed as follows -
1.First, we have to traverse the array elements using a for loop.
2.In each iteration of for loop, compare the search element with the current array element, and -
3.If the element matches, then return the index of the corresponding array element.
4.If the element does not match, then move to the next element.
5.If there is no match or the search element is not present in the given array, return -1.

#### Now, let's see the algorithm of linear search.
Linear_Search(a, n, val) // 'a' is the given array, 'n' is the size of given array, 'val' is the value to search  
Step 1: set pos = -1  
Step 2: set i = 1  
Step 3: repeat step 4 while i <= n  
Step 4: if a[i] == val  
set pos = i  
print pos  
go to step 6  
[end of if]  
set ii = i + 1  
[end of loop]  
Step 5: if pos = -1  
print "value is not present in the array "  
[end of if]  
Step 6: exit  

##### Linear Search complexity
Now, let's see the time complexity of linear search in the best case, average case, and worst case. We will also see the space complexity of linear search.
**Best Case Complexity** - 
In Linear search, best case occurs when the element we are finding is at the first position of the array. The best-case time complexity of linear search is O(1).
**Average Case Complexity** - 
The average case time complexity of linear search is O(n).
**Worst Case Complexity** - 
In Linear search, the worst case occurs when the element we are looking is present at the end of the array. The worst-case in linear search could be when the target element is not present in the given array, and we have to traverse the entire array. The worst-case time complexity of linear search is O(n).
The time complexity of linear search is O(n) because every element in the array is compared only once.
